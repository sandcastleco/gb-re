As sole member and principal of the company he founded, GB Real Estate Investments, LLC, Garritt primarily works to develop new stores for national retail and restaurant chains.  This process includes finding the right property, seeking all necessary municipal approvals, and overseeing the financing and construction of the project to meet the retailer’s needs.  Since 2007, Garritt has been directly responsible for nearly $10 million in new development and has secured properties for clients whose developments have topped $85 million.

In addition to suburban retail development, urban redevelopment is also a focus.  Beginning in 2013, Garritt undertook the development of Whitney Park Townhomes, a first-of-its-kind residential development in Green Bay that redeveloped a block of dilapidated rental houses into new modern, owner-occupied townhomes.  This project nearly quadrupled the value of the block within its near-downtown neighborhood.  New developments worth over $15 million nearby are now proposed, in addition to new streetscaping and park improvements that are intended to generate even further investment.

Before the 2007 founding of GB Real Estate Investments, LLC, a Wisconsin-based limited liability company and licensed real estate brokerage, Garritt worked for Hunt Real Estate Services, Inc., a Tampa, Florida-based developer of single-tenant retail properties throughout the United States.  He graduated from Marquette University with a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering and a minor in Business Administration, and from the University of Florida with a Master’s degree in Business Administration – Real Estate.  Garritt is based in Green Bay and is a licensed real estate broker in Wisconsin and Florida.  

Garritt is a member of the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) and also dedicates his time to several organizations whose missions foster economic development.  He is on the Board of Directors for On Broadway, Inc., a downtown Main Street program, and on the Physical Improvements Committee for Downtown Green Bay, Inc., and Olde Main Street, Inc., two Business Improvement Districts.  He is also a member of the Board of Visitors for the Donald J. Schneider School of Business & Economics at St. Norbert College; the Real Estate Alumni Board at Marquette University’s Center for Real Estate; and the Current Young Professionals’ Steering Committee through the Greater Green Bay Chamber.
